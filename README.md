I honestly can't find the article but I read a disaster relief team at IBM came up with the same idea, expecting the self contained devices to help communicate to remote places in a flood. I just wanted to say I thought of it first, and I won't say what hackathon but a judge made fun of me and this idea to my face and laughed at me. I didn't follow through with my project, but that was discouraging. But I bounced back.
