Digital Black Box - Save Memories

I submitted my project to a hackathon before this article was posted.

I honestly can't find the article (it's not the one I linked) but I read a disaster relief team at IBM came up with the same idea, expecting the self contained devices to help communicate to remote places in a flood. After one of the hurricanes. I just wanted to say I thought of it before those articles came out, and I won't say what hackathon but a judge made fun of me and this idea to my face and laughed at me. He said sarcastically "the water would wash the raspberry pi?" acting like it was a dumb idea because how would people have internet. I didn't follow through with my project but I am glad others did, but that was discouraging.


The idea is to have a self contained RPi that can act as an access point for information, as a server. They are very low energy and a big battery bank could make them last for days. Another idea was to deploy many to make a mesh network. Another idea was to have them located at places like churches, while the internet would be down, people could still access a limited set of resources. Personally I wanted there to be two way communication, for you to be able to upload and send information to the RPi like your location.
